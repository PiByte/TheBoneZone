/*
Particle engine
will handle all of the particles effect
Examples include:
- explosions
- snowfall/rainfall
 stuff of that nature

 How the hell are we defining particle effects?
 are we maybe supposed to write how they should behave ourself,
 or should they be predefined?

/*
Things you can tweak with these:
- emission area (area/point where they should come from, if its a larger area, then they will be placed out randomly)
- direction (0-360 degrees)
- speed (0 >)
- color
- size (they will be drawn as circles)
- timeout (ms)
- amount
